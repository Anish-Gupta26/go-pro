- 2 functtions cant have same function name. To resolve this we can use methods 
- Function syntax - 
  func Name(obj StructName) returnType {

  }
  To access it - Name(obj)
- method syntax - 
  func (obj StructName) Name() returnType{

  }
  To access it - obj.Name()
  // This is equivalent to using 'this' pointer in C++

- interfaces in go is used for reusability of code. It comtaines function names. 
If any structure has same function name with same return type then by default it will be a part of the interface. structure object can be passed to a interface object.

  type InterfaceName interface{
    funcName returnType()
  }

- Table driven tests to make your assertions clearer and your test suites easier to extend & maintain
    - This is done by making array of interface objects
